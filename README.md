# Don't Follow Decoys

This is my Keynote slidedeck from my keynote talk at UtahJS 2016. The topic was Don't Follow Decoys. 

As an adult I have had time to reflect on the many times in life that I have been involved with, as well as witnessed, leadership that is not functional. Often times we are faced with people in leadership roles, who are the official leaders of our groups or teams, however, they don't possess high-quality leadership skills. I refer to these leaders as Decoys. They looks like a leader, and are even referred to as the leader. However, their actions and/or words do the opposite of inspire those whom they are meant to lead. 

A decoy is a "thing-like" object. It looks like a "thing", but is never was, and never will be a "thing". It's sole purpose is to make you think it is a "thing" for as long as it possibly can. 

In this talk I give examples of decoys from the real world, as well as from the world in which developers live. I give red-flags to look for, that may aid you as you attempt to find and weed out decoys. And ultimately, I give tips on how to co-exist with decoys, including tips on how to help minimize the damage that they bring upon you and others.
